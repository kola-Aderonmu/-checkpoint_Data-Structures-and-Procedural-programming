#DISTINCT SUM
Give the Algorithm a name. (ie ALGORITHM Distinct Sum)
Declear TWO SETS OF ARRAY OF INTERGERS which would be sumed.   
Initialize SUM to 0
Initialize i to zero
check elements present in SET 1 and SET 2 arrays. 
Compare elements in both arrays using element in set 1.
if distinct elements are found, then save it in a new array of set3.
sum  set3 elements.


#DOT PRODUCT

Getting the product of V1 and V2
Declare variables
If the length of V1 is equal to v2 it would run else it would skip
It would run a loop through the vectors to multiply them by themselves
After multiplying the values, add it to the value of ps
Write out PS

#Check if the product is orthorgonal

Loop through vector pairs to check for orthogonality
Ensure a vector pair is not multiplied by itself
Call procedure to get dot product of 2 vector pairs
If vectors are orthogonal, write msg that functions are orthogonal
